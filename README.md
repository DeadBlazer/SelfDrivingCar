# Self Driving Car:
- Run below command, to start an emulated environment where you can see a toy car
- Use your mouse, left click and drag, to drop sands
- With mouse now you can create your own road/sand ways, where the car will learn to drive on its own.
- Go a head and create different paths and see how it adopts to the environment
- If you wanna develope this from scratch, then follow Steps 1 to 5, which introduces you the Kivy UI framework from Step 1 to Step 4 
- In Step-5 we use Torch to implement Deep Learning based Q Learning, a special RL algorirthm that learns the environment and helps the agent(car) to navigate avoiding the sand
